# WinRemote

WinRemote is a Python-based program designed to enable remote control of Windows systems from another device for convenient access and management.

## Features

- Remote command execution on Windows systems.
- Simple client-server architecture using sockets.
- Easily configurable host and port settings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows operating system (server-side)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/winremote.git
   cd winremote
   ```

2. Run the server on the Windows machine you want to control:

   ```bash
   python win_remote.py
   ```

3. On the client machine, use the following code to send commands:

   ```python
   from win_remote import WinRemoteClient

   client = WinRemoteClient('server_ip_address')
   client.send_command('your_command_here')
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Server:**
   - Run the server script on the Windows machine to listen for incoming connections.

2. **Connect as a Client:**
   - Use the client script from another device to connect to the server and execute commands remotely.

3. **Execute Commands:**
   - Use standard shell commands to interact with the remote Windows system.
